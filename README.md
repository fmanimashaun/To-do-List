# To Do list

## Overview

In this project, I built a simple HTML list of To Do tasks with focus on it structure using Javascript to load the html elements dynamically. In  addition, I implemented the CRUD (create, read, update, delete) methods as a way to add, remove or update the task list. This simple web page was built using webpack and served by a webpack dev server.

## Project Objectives (Work-in-progress)

### Page Structure

- [x] A new project was setup with webpack that is based on the [webpack exercise](https://github.com/fmanimashaun/webpack-boilerplate) completed earlier.
- [x] Create an index.html file and write your HTML markup here. Create an empty To Do List placeholder using `<div>` element. The index.html file was set as a template using the HTML Webpack Plugin.
- [x] Create an index.js file and set an array of some simple to do tasks (array of objects). Each task object should contain three keys:

    i.    description [`string`]
    
    ii.   completed [`bool`]
    
    iii.  index: [`number`]

- [x] Created a function to iterate over the tasks array and populate an HTML list item element for each task.
- [x] On page load render the dynamically created list of tasks in the dedicated placeholder. The list appear in order of the index values for each task.
- [x] Create a style.css and set rules for the To Do List. CSS was loaded by Webpack Style/CSS Loader.


### Page add & remove functionality

- [x] Create a new JavaScript file for the new functionality.
- [x] Implement a function for adding a new task (add a new element to the array).
- [x] Implement a function for deleting a task (remove an element from the array).
- [x] Implement a function for editing task descriptions.
- [x] By default new tasks should have the property completed set to false and the property index set to the value of the new array length (i.e. if you're adding a 5th task to the list, the index of that task should equal to 5).
- [x] Deleting a task updates all remaining items' indexes, so they represent the current list order and are unique(i.e. if we delete the first task index 1 from the list, the index of the next task(2) will set to 1)..
- [x] All changes to the To Do List should be saved in local storage.
